        I am a full stack developer based in Phoenix, AZ. I create responsive, engaging web apps. <br/><br/>

        I am a re-invented software programmer. My history is steeped in software and programming. Through most of high school and college, I learned to code everything from Excel pivot tables to object oriented programs. I began my career working as a COBOL programmer, and then branched out as a content designer/developer/marketer, but found myself drawn back by the simplicity and power of the black screen. I honed the tools of the webdev trade at DevMountain, where I recently completed the web development immersive program. I now combine my creative skills in design with efficient programming to present an interface that is as appealing as it is functional.<br/><br/>

        Cerebral challenges get me going everyday. I am a lifelong learner, and aspire to work with people who keep my curiosity kindled.<br/><br/>

        I am currently learning all about D3 at freecodecamp.org. Feel free to bookmark this page to see what I'm creating and learning.
